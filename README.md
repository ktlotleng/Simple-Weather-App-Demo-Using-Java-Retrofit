# Simple-Weather-App-Demo-Using-Java-Retrofit

A simple Java application that pulls data from an API using Retrofit.

This application only demonstrates how to work with an online API using Retrofit. It acts as a demo application to a full weather app, this is not a full app, which is evident by it's simplicity. You can use it as a skeleton to make your own full weather application.

The application pulls data from Metaweather.com/api using Retrofit. The API endpoint is in a JSON format.
